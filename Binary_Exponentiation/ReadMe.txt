Q.Micro and Prime Prime

Micro just learned about prime numbers. 
But he quickly got bored of them, 
so he defined a new kind of numbers and 
called them Prime Prime Numbers. 
A number X is Prime Prime if number of prime numbers from 1 to X 
(inclusive) are prime. Now he wants to find out the number of 
Prime Prime numbers from L to R (inclusive). Help Micro with it.
